    2020 living in London, working in marketing and media. Working from home due to the terrible global pandemic. I missed going out for my morning daily fix of caffeine, having all coffee shops closed. I became the owner of my very first Espresso Maker at home. I then realised that it was possible to replicate a true Coffee Shop coffee at home without imagining that so many numbers, calculations and skills would come into play. Which I find fascinating.
    
    I am not a barista but love coffee. My go-to drink is Flat White and its substitute Piccolo. I decided to go on a journey to learn about coffee and its complexity.
    
    Whether you're a coffee-lover, home barista or a casual coffee drinker. Whether its latte art, roasting coffee or pulling the best shot of espresso.
    
    I am here to share my journey good and bad experiences and guide people in similar situations to get the perfect brew at home and decide the best coffee maker that will fit your lifestyle.
    
    Whether you're a coffee-lover, home barista or a casual coffee drinker. Whether its latte art, roasting coffee or pulling the best shot of espresso I am dedicated to helping you understand the world of coffee better through my learning.
    
    Along the way, I made an Instagram, a Youtube Channel, and started a blog. I hope that by reading my blog or watching my videos, you will learn with me and we can discover the best ways to recreate your favourite coffee shop moments at home
    
    I'd love to hear about your experiences drop me a message and let me know. I'm always open to new ideas and grab a cup of coffee.`,
